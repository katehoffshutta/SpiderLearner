# Loading SpiderLearner

To load the SpiderLearner code itself, simply source the R script:

```{R message=F}
source("SpiderLearner.R")
```

# Loading Example Data

```{R message=F}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
  install.packages("BiocManager")

# Uncomment this line to install the affy and curatedOvarianData package 
# Takes time, so re-comment after
# BiocManager::install("affy")
# BiocManager::install("curatedOvarianData")

library(affy)
library(curatedOvarianData)
```

# Extracting and Standardizing Example Data

```{R}
standardize = function(x){return((x-mean(x))/sd(x))}

data(GSE32062.GPL6480_eset)
lateStage = exprs(GSE32062.GPL6480_eset)
lateStageClinicalInfo = pData(GSE32062.GPL6480_eset)

# Instantiating the SpiderLearner and Adding Candidates

```{R}
s = SpiderLearner$new()

apple = HugeEBICCandidate$new(gamma = 0)
banana = HugeEBICCandidate$new(gamma = 0.5)
clementine = HugeRICCandidate$new()
date = HGlassoCandidate$new()
elderberry = MLECandidate$new() 
fraise = HugeStARSCandidate$new(thres = 0.05)
grape = HugeStARSCandidate$new(thres = 0.1)
honeydew = QGraphEBICCandidate$new(gamma = 0)
icewine = QGraphEBICCandidate$new(gamma = 0.5)

candidates = list(apple, 
                  banana, 
                  clementine, 
                  date, 
                  elderberry,
                  fraise,
                  grape,
                  honeydew,
                  icewine)

for(candidate in candidates)
{
  s$addCandidate(candidate)
}
```

# Running the SpiderLearner

Here is the syntax for running the model. Output is fairly long, so I have suppressed it here. 

```{R eval=FALSE}
slResults = s$runSpiderLearner(lateStageSmall, K = 10, standardize=T, nCores = 1)
```

```{R include=FALSE}
slResults = s$runSpiderLearner(lateStageSmall, K = 10, standardize=T, nCores = 1)
```

# Investigating SpiderLearner Results

You can begin by looking at the weights of each candidate:

```{R}
round(slResults$weights,3)
```

A correlation plot of the SpiderLearner-estimated precision matrix will give you an idea of the sparsity of your estimated GGM:

```{R message=F}
library(corrplot)
corrplot(slResults$optTheta,is.corr=F)
```

You can also access any of the precision matrices estimated by the candidate models - for example, here is the MLE:

```{R}
corrplot(slResults$fullModels[[5]],is.corr=F)
```

To plot the SpiderLearner GGM, we first convert the SpiderLearner precision matrix to the adjacency matrix of the corresponding GGM (matrix of partial correlations):

```{R}
adjMat = -cov2cor(slResults$optTheta)
```

Next, we can create and plot an `igraph` graph object from this matrix:

```{R}
slGraph = graph_from_adjacency_matrix(adjMat,weighted=T,mode="undirected",diag=F)
E(slGraph)$width = 10*abs(E(slGraph)$weight)
E(slGraph)$color = ifelse(E(slGraph)$weight>0,"red","blue")
plot(slGraph,
     vertex.color="white",
     vertex.shape = "rectangle",
     vertex.size = 60,
     vertex.size2= 20,
     layout=layout_with_graphopt)
```
